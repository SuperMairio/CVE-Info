# CVE-Info
A tool for automating CVE searching. It gathers:
- CVE ID
- CVSS score
- Summary
- Access
- Impact

boringOutput.csv is for spreadhsheet software (so you can do number crunching and other fun things) and output.csv is more readable

In getinfo.py there is a sleep after each request to try and prevent the website thinking it's being DoS-ed but feel free to remove if you too like to live dangerously


## How to use

1. Install all of the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
2. Use getCVEs.py to generate a csv file of relevant CVE numbers: `python getCVEs.py` 
    1. Enter the number of search terms you wish to look for 
    2. Enter the search terms, seperating each one with a line break
    3. Press enter and grab a coffee (can take a few seconds before you see any output so please be patient, it is working I promise!)
3. Run getinfo.py to generate files containing CVE details `python getinfo.py`
    1. You can use your own CVE file if you wish, just ensure it is called cve.csv and is in the same directory
    2. Don't worry about duplicate CVEs, this script removes them for you!
