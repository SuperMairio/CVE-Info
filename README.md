# CVE-Info
Gets information about CVEs

boringOutput.csv is for spreadhsheet software and output.csv is more readable

In getinfo.py there is a sleep after each request to try and prevent the website thinking it's being DoS-ed but feel free to remove if you too like to live dangerously

You can provide your own csv of CVE numbers or run getCVEs to do that for you
