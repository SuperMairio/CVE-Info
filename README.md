# CVE-Info
Gets information about CVEs
(Current cve.csv contains Docker CVEs for my disertation)

boringOutput.csv is for spreadhsheet software and output.csv is more readable

There is a sleep after each request to try and prevent the website thinking it's being DoS-ed but feel free to remove if you too like to live dangerously

## How to use
- `pip install ares` 
- Put CVEs in cve.csv file
- `python getInfo.py`
