# CVE-Info
A tool for automating CVE searching. It gathers:
- CVE ID
- CVSS score
- Summary
- Access
- Impact

boringOutput.csv is for spreadhsheet software (so you can do number crunching and other fun things) and output.csv is more readable

In getinfo.py there is a sleep after each request to try and prevent the website thinking it's being DoS-ed but feel free to remove if you too like to live dangerously

You can provide your own csv of CVE numbers or run getCVEs to do that for you
